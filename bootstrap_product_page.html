<p3>Say you find a fantastic ocean-side property on a realty website. You are unsure as to whether you will 
have to get flood or hurricane insurance, or how often damage from natural disasters will affect the property.</p3>
<p3> Unfortunately, many websites do not offer such information, the way they would offer information about the crime levels and school ratings near the property.</p3>
<p></P></div><div class = "container"><div class = "jumbotron"><H1>That's where Cozy comes in.</H1></div></div><div class = "container">
<p>Cozy is a free chrome extension that calculates the impact of certain natural disasters on a specific property. It uses databases to inform the prospective homeowner about the chances of 
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. The easy-to-understand and helpfully visual UI allows any user to make a more informed home-buying decision. Cozy allows prospective homeowners to understand the risks they may face, so they can make informed decisions about whether they should purchase a certain home, if they should invest in methods to protect their home, or if they should purchase natural disaster insurance. Current homeowners can also use this application to learn about the risks of natural disasters where they currently live, so that they can be better prepared for future disasters. </p>
